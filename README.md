# Welcome to the Chromatic Aberration Correction Toolbox!

This toolbox attempts to determine a correction matrix to fix chromatic 
aberration in microscope images. 

## Features
- Calculates corrections between images captured in different channels
- Applies corrections to ND2 images
- Data analysis tools to visualize the correction

## Installation and Usage
